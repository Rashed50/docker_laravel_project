## Laravel Project in Docker Environment

Laravel is a web application framework. Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for developing, testing, and deploying source code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and deployment the application in production. Docker provides tools and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:

- Develop your application and its supporting components using containers and container image.
- The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
- When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.
